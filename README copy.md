##Animal Observer toolbox

This repository includes the R and markdown code necessary to customize **_Animal Observer_**, an iPad application designed by the [Dian Fossey Gorilla Fund](http://www.gorillafund.org) to collect animal behavior data in the field or in captivity. Additional tools are also provided to convert output files generated by **_Animal Observer_** to csv files.
